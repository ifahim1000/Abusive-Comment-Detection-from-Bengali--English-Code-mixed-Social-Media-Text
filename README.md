# Abusive Comment Detection from Bengali English Code-mixed Social Media-Text using Ensemble of Deep Learning

Code-mixing, the practice of seamlessly combining multiple languages within a single conversation or text, has become increasingly prevalent in online communication platforms. The rise of code-mixed content poses challenges for natural language processing tasks, particularly in identifying abusive comments, which are harmful and offensive in nature.

This research presents a novel ensemble of deep learning approach to detect abusive comments from Bengali-English code-mixed data.To enhance the performance of the model, a custom-built Bengali-English code-mixed dataset is curated, comprising diverse examples of abusive and non-abusive comments. The experimental evaluation is conducted on the curated dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting abusive comments in code-mixed data. Our proposed <b>`CNN(GLOVE)+LSTM(GLOVE)+BiLSTM(FastText)`</b> acheived highest accuracy of highest accuracy <b>0.81</b> and F1 score of highest accuracy <b>0.77</b>.Overall, this research contributes to the field of natural language processing by addressing the growing concern of abusive content in code-mixed data, facilitating the development of safer and more inclusive online environments for multilingual users.
