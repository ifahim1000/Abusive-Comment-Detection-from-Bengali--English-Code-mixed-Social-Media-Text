# Abusive Comment Detection from Bengali English Code-mixed Social Media-Text using Ensemble of Deep Learning

Code-mixing, the practice of seamlessly combining multiple languages within a single conversation or text, has become increasingly prevalent in online communication platforms. The rise of code-mixed content poses challenges for natural language processing tasks, particularly in identifying abusive comments, which are harmful and offensive in nature. This research presents a novel ensemble of deep learning approach to detect abusive comments from Bengali-English code-mixed data.To enhance the performance of the model, a custom-built Bengali-English code-mixed dataset is curated, comprising diverse examples of abusive and non-abusive comments. The experimental evaluation is conducted on the curated dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting abusive comments in code-mixed data. Our proposed `CNN(GLOVE)+LSTM(GLOVE)+BiLSTM(FastText)` acheived highest accuracy of
highest accuracy 0.81 and F1 score of highest accuracy 0.77.Overall, this research contributes to the field of natural language processing by addressing the growing concern of abusive content in code-mixed data, facilitating the development of safer and more inclusive online environments for multilingual users.
